#TODO
1. Remove noticeable names from the excel file
2. Redirect logs to a file
3. Add authentication to each form field
  a. Phone number must be 10 digit number without decimal(excel adds decimal to numbers based on column format)
  b. Date should be valid
  c. Any limit on the number of characters or type of characters for name / address
  d. Authentication for PAN - 10 digit alphanumeric
  e. PIN - 6 digit number
  f. Nationality - finding the list of countries in the web ui and comparing is just too much work at this tme. We ll just check for alphabets without numberic or special chars
  g. All fields - should not be none/null and length should be greated than 0
  h. When authentication fails a neat message without exceptions or stack traces.
